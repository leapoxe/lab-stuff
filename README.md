Thanks for your interest in this project! 

This is an ongoing coding project for my lab. The purpose of the project is to make the data extraction and analysis process more convenient for researchers who have to handle a large amount of raw and uncleaned data. 
The project is not completely finished yet. There are more features that have yet to be added. Our lab has many other projects going on as well, so the completion process of this particular project might take some time. 
This project is also an collaborative project. Some of the other lab members have also contributed to the code. Therefore, I share the credits with my fellow lab assistants.
